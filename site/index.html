                   Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world invented by a shadowy person SATOSHI NAKAMOTO and it was started in 2009 when its implementation was released as an open source software. Bitcoin is an application of blockchain technology but most poeple tend to believe bitcoin and blockchain are same. Bitcoin helps in peer to peer transaction of values globally without any intermediaries and thus becoming completely decentralised. It is noted for its imutability and decentralised network. Bitcoin has a distributed ledger of transaction across the world. It is disruptive application of blockchain technology bringing many revolution in banking and business sector.

                    Being an application of BlockChain technology bitcoin stores the transaxtion data in blocks. Every transaction is digitally signatured by hashing the public and private keys of receiver and sender respectively. The entire block is hashed to solve a certain puzzle of Proof of Work done by all the miners who take charge of the nodes across the world. While hashing the next block the previous block hash is taken into consideration and hashed along. Thus when someone tries to tamper the data in certain block it would result in a change of preceding block's Hash value. This wouldnt be possible since there are numerous nodes all over the world having the data of entire blockchain monitoring it.

                <p>
                    In bitcoin for every 10 minutes a block is mined and the miner gets to start the next block. He also receives a prize value(currently 6.5 BTC) for successfully mining the block and adding the block to the blockchain. Once the data is added to the blockchain it becomes immutable. The miner has to solve a puzzle of certain difficulty. He would add a value called 'nonce' to the blockhash value to arrive at the required hashvalue of stated difficulty. Finding  the nonce is the game played by mining pools across the world.
